Known Bugs

	This release was tested on Solaris Sun JDK 1.1.6, 1.2beta2 and 1.2beta4.

	There are a number of rendering bugs in the 1.2beta (image copy - which
	shows up in double-buffered appliactions and clipping) which hopefully
	will be fixed by FCS. 1.2beta4 has very slow graphics and Mica repaint
	problems.

	Save and load does not know how to handle Z-connections or annotation
	or connections points.
