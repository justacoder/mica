How to Build Mica

1. Add the 'mica/classes' directory to the CLASSPATH.

2. Change the current directory to mica/com/classes/mica

3. Type 'make'. Note that this is a unix-style makefile
and that the makefile also uses 'sed', a unix utility.
At this time we do not have NT-specific, Windows-specific
or MAC-specific makefiles. However GNU, MKS and other
organizations provide tools that will provide (hopefully)
equivalent functionality to the unix 'make' and 'sed'
tools.
