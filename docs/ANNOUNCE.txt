ANNOUNCE: The Mica Graphics Framework Version 1.1 (Alpha)
===================================================


Software Farm, Inc. is proud to announce the availability of
the 3rd release of Mica, a free graphics and user interface
toolkit for Java programmers who want easy, powerful, and 
extraordinarily graphical user interfaces for their 
appletcations.

Specifically, Mica is a modern object-oriented 2D graphics
library with a heavy emphasis on ease of use, portability 
and the ability to mix common user-interface widgets with
not so common widgets and graphs.
	
Mica provides a host of advanced features, including:

*	A large number of standard widgets (including
	a table, tree list, and property panels)

*	A large number of (node-arc) graph layouts

*	Object-oriented look (every visible artifact is
	an object) and feel (all event handling is handled
	by event handler objects)

*	Automatic layout validation and/or redraw when
	components are changed

*	A suite of appletcations including a network
	graph editor and a diagramming tool with customizable
	drag-and-drop palettes which reads and writes simple
	ASCII text graphics files

Mica is available on the web for general evaluation and use. 
The source code and class files are provided free of charge.

This is an alpha release for JDK 1.1 or better.
